### Game Concept

#### About

You've responded to a destress call from the Tribble homeworld, Iota Geminorum IV. The Tribble's are currently under attack by a Klingon armada that was sent by the Klingon Empire to destroy the Tribble homeworld. The Tribble's have no means of defense and you're the only ship around for lightyears in this star system. It's up to you to save the Tribbles from the Klingon's!

#### Objective

* Player needs to collect(by clicking) falling/moving tribbles before time runs out.

  * Successfully clicking on a Tribble will add a point to the scoreboard.

  * Successfully clicking on a Klingon will subtract a point from the scoreboard.

* 5(or more) round game

  * Each round requires a minimum score to successfully progress to the next round.

    * With each round progression the new round will require a higher minimum score

* Successfully pass each round to WIN the game! ^-^
